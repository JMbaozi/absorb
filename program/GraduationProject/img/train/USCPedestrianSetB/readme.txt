The "USC pedestrian set B" is collected from the CAVIAR video corpus to evaluate frontal/rear view walking/standing
human detection algorithm in presence of partially inter-human occlusion. This set contains 54 images, 
with 271 humans. The groundtruth is provided in XML format.

If your publication includes any experimental 
results obtained on any images from this set, please acknowlege the use of the "USC pedestrian set B"
and reference the following paper:

of Edgelet Part Detectors. ICCV'05, Beijing, China, Oct 17-20, 2005.

Without permission from USC vision group, images from within the 
dataset cannot be incorporated into a larger database which is then publicly distributed.
